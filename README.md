# doc-recog
Text-based doc recognition

The goal of this project is to allow document recognition and data extraction based on pre-defined templates. Templates define key elements that if found help determine the document type. Once the document recognition is complete it's possible to extract specific information from the document or tag using a QR code, for example.
